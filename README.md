# TraJ
Simple Android app for quickly recording handwritten online trajectories.
It was used to record the [Online-Handwritten George Washington Dataset].

If a text file containing words to write is used ("Start with source", one word per line in text file), 
the app annotates each trajectory by including the represented word in the resulting filename (e.g. "6748515_company.txt").
